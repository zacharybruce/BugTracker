# CodeDefense Bug Tracker

Web application that allows the user to add bugs for multiple projects. The website requires the user to login remotely or exernally using a Google account. The bugs can be given either a low, normal, high, or immediate priority and a status (Active or Solved).

# Motivation

The application was made so I could keep track of bugs within my different projects.  I also wanted more experience working with ASP.Net MVC, as well as connecting an application to a SQL database using Entity Framework.

# Build Status

The project builds and works successfully. However, there is still work to be done.

#Tech/Framework Used

Uses ASP.Net MVC in Visual Studio.
